# Know thy author

"To thine own self be true.” Hamlet, Act I, Scene III 

Born and raised in the vibrant tapestry of Dhaka, Bangladesh, my journey into the world of academia and research has been a mosaic of diverse experiences and unending passion. From the bustling streets of Dhaka to the heartland of the United States, my curiosity and love for exploration led me to Missouri State University, where I forged lifelong connections and embraced the beauty of the world through my twin passions for travel and photography.

My academic odyssey truly commenced in the bustling halls of Missouri State University, where I delved into the enigmatic realms of cardiovascular development. Fascinated by the intricate dance of Vascular smooth muscle cell maturation and migration on high flow specific blood vessels, my undergraduate years laid the foundation for my deep-rooted love for research.

Eager for further exploration and knowledge, I embarked on a transformative journey to Cleveland, Ohio, to pursue my masters in Regenerative Medicine and Entrepreneurship at Case Western Reserve University. Here, the corridors of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center became my summer haven, as I was honored with the ENGAGE summer research scholar title, delving into the realms of hematopoietic aging and the potential of a 15-PGDH inhibitor drug in reversing aging indicators.

My thirst for knowledge and impact only grew. As a research technician II at Cleveland Clinic's Center for Immunotherapy and Precision Immuno Oncology, I contributed to groundbreaking discoveries and nurtured my passion for scientific innovation.

Now, as a first-year PhD student in the Clinical Translational Science program at Case Western Reserve University, I am poised to deepen my expertise in data analysis using R. I see my academic journey not only as a personal quest but as a means to pave the way for a brighter future for the people of my homeland. My ultimate aspiration is to channel my learnings and experiences into creating solutions that will positively impact the lives of those in Bangladesh. With each step forward, I am dedicated to realizing this dream, contributing to the advancement of science and, one day, building something truly impactful for my community.
