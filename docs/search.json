From the bustling streets of Dhaka to the heartland of the United States, my curiosity and love for exploration led me to Missouri State University, where I forged lifelong connections and embraced the beauty of the world through my twin passions for travel and photography.\nMy academic odyssey truly commenced in the bustling halls of Missouri State University, where I delved into the enigmatic realms of cardiovascular development. Fascinated by the intricate dance of Vascular smooth muscle cell maturation and migration on high flow specific blood vessels, my undergraduate years laid the foundation for my deep-rooted love for research.\nEager for further exploration and knowledge, I embarked on a transformative journey to Cleveland, Ohio, to pursue my masters in Regenerative Medicine and Entrepreneurship at Case Western Reserve University. Here, the corridors of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center became my summer haven, as I was honored with the ENGAGE summer research scholar title, delving into the realms of hematopoietic aging and the potential of a 15-PGDH inhibitor drug in reversing aging indicators.\nMy thirst for knowledge and impact only grew. As a research technician II at Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Immunotherapy and Precision Immuno Oncology, I contributed to groundbreaking discoveries and nurtured my passion for scientific innovation.\nNow, as a first-year PhD student in the Clinical Translational Science program at Case Western Reserve University, I am poised to deepen my expertise in data analysis using R. I see my academic journey not only as a personal quest but as a means to pave the way for a brighter future for the people of my homeland. My ultimate aspiration is to channel my learnings and experiences into creating solutions that will positively impact the lives of those in Bangladesh. With each step forward, I am dedicated to realizing this dream, contributing to the advancement of science and, one day, building something truly impactful for my community.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nDoctor of Philosophy in Clinical Translational Science | 07/2023- Present\nSchool of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio\n\n\nMaster of Science in Regenerative Medicine and Entrepreneurship | 08/2021-01/2023\nSchool of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH\n\n\nBachelor of Science in Microbiology and Biotechnology/ Minor in Chemistry | 01/2017- 12/2020\nCollege of Natural and Applied Sciences, Missouri State University, Springfield, MO\n\n\n\n\nExperience\n\nVice President 10/2022- Present Steiner House Cooperation,Cleveland, Ohio\n• Welcome new residents, provide orientation, and craft welcome letters for admission packets to facilitate a smooth transition for newcomers.\n• Organize and coordinate monthly indoor and outdoor events, fostering resident engagement and maintaining event records via the Steiner House party planner Google sheet.\n• Manage budget-conscious event hosting, subsidizing resident participation, and organize mandatory house events within set budgets, such as Thanksgiving, Graduation, Halloween, Spring Cleaning, Holiday Party, and Asian New Year celebrations.\n• Ensure house functionality by regularly checking the suggestion box, resolving internal issues by discussing with involved members, attending executive committee meetings, and assuming the role of Acting President during the President’s temporary absence, ensuring continuous leadership.\n\n\nResearch Technician II 04/2023-07/2023 McGrail Lab| Center for Immunotherapy and Immuno-Oncology| Lerner Research Institute-Cleveland Clinic | Cleveland, Ohio\n• Develop novel immunotherapies and optimize patient stratification for immune checkpoint blockade to improve patient outcomes.\n• Analyze large-scale clinical data and experimental models to identify biomarkers and new therapeutic targets to enhance clinical outcomes.\n• Proficient in utilizing basic laboratory techniques and equipment operation to perform experiments under supervision, as well as fulfilling general laboratory duties, including maintaining lab supplies, ensuring safety protocols, and keeping meticulous records of experimental data.\n• Contribute to translational research for a comprehensive understanding of cancer biology and other complex diseases, with a focus on developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes.\n\n\nIntern 02/2023-04/2023- Bonfield Lab| National Center for Regenerative Medicine| Case Western Reserve University| Cleveland, Ohio\n• Conduct research on the use of mesenchymal stem cells in immunotherapy, with a focus on novel applications for chronic lung inflammation e.g., Cystic Fibrosis, Asthma, bronchopulmonary disease and allergy/anaphylaxis.\n• Performed in vitro assays to evaluate mesenchymal stem cell-mediated effects on immune cell function, including T cell activation and cytokine production.\n\n\nGraduate Research Assistant 03/2022- 08/2022 -Desai lab| Case Comprehensive Cancer Center |Case Western Reserve University| Cleveland, Ohio\n• Led research on the use of 15- Hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase inhibition on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging at Desai lab, resulting in the award of ENGAGE scholar award from National Center of Regenerative Medicine securing funding for the project.\n• Contributed to the development of novel therapeutic approach for novel therapeutic approach for HSC aging using hematopoietic based therapy and presented findings at Case Comprehensive Cancer center and Cleveland Clinic for Regenerative medicine conference.\n• Gained expertise in sample preparation and analyzing in-vitro tissues for molecular cell-based methodologies by HSC culture and manipulation, Flow cytometry, Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), organ harvest of 60-week-old mice models\n\n\nUndergraduate Research Assistant 04/2019 – 05/2021 -Udan lab| Missouri State University, Springfield, MO\n• Assisted with the maintenance and culture of cell lines and primary cells used in cardiovascular development research.\n• Assisted with animal surgeries and post-operative care and obtained tissue samples for downstream analysis.\n• Record and maintain accurate research documentation and perform initial analyses to identify non-conforming data points and/or interpret outcomes. o Data analysis software: Microsoft Excel, LabTracks, Minitab\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nENGAGE - Research Scholar Award- National Center of Regenerative Medicine · May 2022\nAssociation: Case Comprehensive Cancer Center- Case Western Reserve University\nNational Center of Regenerative Medicine has awarded ENGAGE summer research training for Summer 2022 on conducting research for regenerative medicine.
